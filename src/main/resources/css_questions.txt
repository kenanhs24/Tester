1|What is CSS?|CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.
2|What are the different types of CSS?|The three types are Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS.
3|What is the difference between Inline, Internal, and External CSS?|Inline CSS is applied directly to elements using the `style` attribute. Internal CSS is written within a `<style>` tag inside the `<head>`. External CSS is stored in separate files and linked to the HTML.
4|What is the purpose of the `id` and `class` selectors in CSS?|`id` selects unique elements, and `class` can be used for multiple elements.
5|What are pseudo-classes in CSS?|Pseudo-classes define the special state of an element, such as `:hover` or `:first-child`.
6|What is the difference between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning in CSS?|Relative positions an element relative to its normal position, absolute positions relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, and fixed positions relative to the viewport.
7|What are media queries?|Media queries enable responsive design by applying styles based on the screen size, resolution, or device type.
